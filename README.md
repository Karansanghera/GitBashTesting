
this programs purpose is to test out scripting using a git bash.


step 1: learn how to create a script file. the way i did this is by typing "nano FILENAME.sh" and that will automaticly
	creat a invoiment fo you yo edit and type into to start creating a script.

step 2: 


step n: condition statemetns not working only works when directory is wrong and give me an error but run the rest of the
	code however when the dir is corect nothing display and bash just let me type with out running what ever i type
	only stops when i press ctrl + c.

	solved issue: issue was that the input was asking for a the exact dir that the file rinning the program is in 
	at first i had put c/Users/$input but what was need was the rest of the dir that the script was int so the final
	was c/Users/$input/gitBashtesting
